# Home Security App

## Description

![CI](https://github.com/xichen-de/HomeSecurityApp/actions/workflows/java-ci.yml/badge.svg)

This is a tool that simulates a home security application. In this application you can add, delete, enable and disable sensor input, read the image from the camera, and enable and disable alarm accordingly. It was developed with Java Swing and tested with JUnit 5 on Ubuntu 20.04. It implements the following requirements:

1. If alarm is armed *and* a sensor becomes activated, put the system into pending alarm status.
2. If alarm is armed *and* a sensor becomes activated *and* the system is already pending alarm, set the alarm status to alarm.
3. If pending alarm *and* all sensors are inactive, return to no alarm state.
4. If alarm is active, change in sensor state should not affect the alarm state.
5. If a sensor is activated *while* already active *and* the system is in pending state, change it to alarm state.
6. If a sensor is deactivated *while* already inactive, make no changes to the alarm state.
7. If the image service identifies an image containing a cat *while* the system is armed-home, put the system into alarm status.
8. If the image service identifies an image that does not contain a cat, change the status to no alarm *as long as* the sensors are not active.
9. If the system is disarmed, set the status to no alarm.
10. If the system is armed, reset all sensors to inactive.
11. If the system is armed-home *while* the camera shows a cat, set the alarm status to alarm.
